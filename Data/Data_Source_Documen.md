# Student Experience in the Research University (SERU) Consortium COVID-19 Survey

### Data Provenance 

#### About the survey
This dataset was generated from the SERU COVID-19 Survye and focuses on the student experience at public research universities in the U.S. it was conducted across nine large institutions.
It assessed five areas to better understand students from different academic levels (undergradutae, graduate, professional) to better understand they experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic.
The areas it covered included "1) students’ transition to remote instruction, 2) the financial impact of COVID-19 on students, 3) students’ health and wellbeing during the pandemic, 4) students’ belonging and engagement, and 5) students’ future plans."
An example of the full survey is listed [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1CEjxYSrsW6XSgA568H5tYyCHwtT4u8Du/view). 

#### Sample
The survey was adminsitered from May 18 to July 2020, the peak of the academic adjustment during the pandemic. It uses data from 28,311 undergraduate students and had a response rate of 14-31% at each institution. Information about the sample demographics may be found 
[here] (https://cshe.berkeley.edu/sites/default/files/seru_and_gradseru_covid-19_survey_sample_information.pdf).

#### Methedology
The items reported in the survey are all categorical so Pearson's chi-square test was used in the analysis to determine the satistically significant difference
between the expected and observed frequencies of students' responses. The probability level of p < 0.05 was used as a priori statement of the probability of an event
" occurring as extreme or more extreme than the one observed if the null hypothesis is true." 

### About the SERU Consortium

It is based at the Center for Studies in higher Eductation at UCB. More information about the SERU Consortium may be found [here](https://cshe.berkeley.edu/seru).

### Licensing

### Possibilites for bias
Since this survey was only conducted across nine research institions, it may not capture the experience of students during the pandemic across all universities in the U.S. --it stands as a generalizaiton/ a representative dataset for the wider collection of public research institions in the U.S.
There may also be bias introduced by the questions presented in the survey. If student input was not considered during the creation of the survey, it may not be representative of the students' needs and concerns and may only reflect those needs and concerns assumed by university/ research officials.
