# Datasets 

We extracted data from the University of California Undergraduate Experience Survey (UCUES) Data Tables for the year 2020. We particularly looked at the data for the University of California, Berkeley across different disciplines: Arts, Humanities, Life Sciences, Engineering/Computer Science, Health Professionals & Clinical Sciences, Physical Sciences and Math, Professional Fields, Social Sciences/Psychology, Undeclared/All other/Unkown. There are 14 survey categories, but we pull data from the categories that have survey questions which focus on mental health and wellbeing. The sections we identified are Satisfaction, Academic Experience and Globalization, and Campus Climate for Diversity.
