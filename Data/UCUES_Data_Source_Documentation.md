# University of California Undergraduate Experience Survey (UCUES) Data Tables
### Data Provenance 

#### About the survey
This survey was conducted across UC's nine undergraduate research universities. They provide valuable information on students' behavior and results are used to "better understand the academic and co-curricular experiences of students, assist with program evaluations, assess financial aid packages, and understand campus climate." The data tables show the responses of students to various questions on student experiences and is representative of various student demographics. The survey is administered by the UC Office of the President, once every two years (e.g., Spring 2014, Spring 2016, Spring 2018). Additionally, survey results are matched with institutional data from campus records.

#### Sample
The survey is administered from March until July of the Spring semester. We focused on the survey for the year 2020. The survey collects responses across the nine UC campuses but we focus on data from UC Berkeley.
