This project is for my Data Science Honors Thesis. 

From May to June 2020, a survey conducted by the Student Experience in the Research University (SERU) Consortium gauged the climate of students’ lives and health during the pandemic. The study was conducted across nine research universities and gave suggestions for the next steps that administrators should take in response to the survey’s results. Their research showed that students with disabilities have higher rates of major depressive disorder (between 53% and 70%) and generalized anxiety disorder (between 63% and 80%) compared to students without disabilities (34% and 38% respectively). 

The purpose of this project is to to empower students with disabilities to reassess the data from the SERU Consortium survey, reevaluate what questions these surveys should ask to accurately represent the disabled student community, and inform the wider UC Berkeley community of their circumstances. Fundamentally, I am interested in how individuals are represented in datasets and if sensitive data on mental health is accurately representing the individuals who are responding to the surveys. My project aims to highlight how we should bring the subjects of the survey conducted by SERU to the frontlines of data collection and analysis. I believe that this approach may help create datasets that better capture the individual’s identity and mental self, which in turn allows for research that better serves the community.
